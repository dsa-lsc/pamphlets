### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
Whereas, our main goal should be to develop DSA into a mass organization composed principally of workers, able to build power through labor, community, electoral, and movement organizing; and

Whereas, to do so we must confront the organizational problems most pressing to us—the need to give all members a voice in our work; the need to grow beyond a predominantly male and white membership to a membership that better reflects the composition of the US working class; and the need to develop an organization able to build and effectively wield power; and

Whereas, while our approach to anti-racist and socialist-feminist organizing should include commitments to creating welcoming spaces, we must also develop strategies to address the substantive and specific challenges black, brown, indigenous, and women workersface in the workplace and society at large; and

Whereas, developing strategies to address these challenges must be informed by the knowledge and experience of those directly impacted, and shaped through their full participation and inclusion in decision making at every level of our organization;

## 3. Towards a Clear Multifaceted Strategy for Labor

### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
Whereas, the inertia of neoliberal economics presses workers deeper into poverty and insecurity, while it simultaneously demands the disempowerment, demobilization, and disenfranchisement of workers as a political class; and

Whereas, over the last sixty years, the organizations that workers forged through struggle as vehicles for their demands have been systematically attacked through deliberate campaigns of legislative and judicial obstruction, public intimidation, and often violence; and

Whereas, labor is not a finite single-issue campaign but an ongoing foundational component of our political project, one which does not merely seek to improve the economic conditions of workers, but does so in pursuit of working-class political power and in the name of working-class agency; and

Whereas, across the US, right-to-work laws and decades of deindustrialization have gutted traditional labor strongholds, as millions of workers have flooded into growing sectorssuch as service and logistics, and as historic and current racial and gender disparities across sectors have left many workers without representation; and

Whereas, our aim must not only be to defend and strengthen the already-existing labor movement but to capture new territory by leading efforts to organize workers in key unorganized sectors; and

Whereas, our goal should be to build an organization with the credibility and strength to one day call hundreds of thousands of workers out to strike when necessary, the path to building such an organization will require a clear strategy, with flexibility based on the diversity of regional labor conditions, along with a serious commitment from our members and their national bodies.

Therefore be it resolved, that the Democratic Socialist Labor Commission (DSLC) shall focus its activity on supporting the development of chapter-level labor formations made up of workers regardless of the unionization status of their workplace; and shall restructure itself to be comprised of members of recognized chapter-level labor formations; and be it

Resolved, the National Political Committee (NPC) shall hire at least one (1) staff labor organizer dedicated solely to supporting the DSLC and local chapter-level labor formations; and be it

Resolved, that the DSLC shall develop programming for regional workplace organizing schools alongside partnering with our youth section to revive DSA’s Campus Labor Institutes; and that these educational initiatives shall be conceived along the following lines: 1) to educate DSA members and the general public about the labor movement, 2) to hold workplace organizer trainings for workers in organized and unorganized workplaces and industries, 3) to proactively include workers from traditionally marginalized backgrounds and job classifications, and 4) to subsidize, to the extent possible, the costs of access and participation for low-wage workers; and be it 

Resolved, that the overall strategy of the DSLC shall be informed by strategic assessments of local conditions, and shall therefore be focused on developing local DSA labor networks that can pursue the following goals: 1) organizing within unions where they exist, especially when doing so provides opportunities to leverage demands against the state for the common good of the working class in general, 2) organizing within strategic industries, particularly where the potential economic impact on capital is greatest, and 3) leading efforts to organize workers in key unorganized sectors.

## 6. Orienting to Latinx Communities

### Authors
* José G. P, Metro Atlanta DSA, Socialist Majority, NPC Candidate

### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
Whereas: The Latinx communities are now the largest oppressed minority in the country, with 18% of the country’s population, some 60 million people, and concentrated among young people. One in five millennials is classified as “Hispanic” by the census bureau; among post-millennials, one in four.

Whereas: The United States has the second largest number of Spanish-speaking people in the world after Mexico, some 55 million people over the age of five. Some 41 million over that age are considered native speakers as that is the main language used in their homes, a number comparable to native speakers in Colombia, Argentina and Spain itself.

Whereas: Due to common oppression, language and cultural elements, as well as modern communications and mass media, these communities have developed a common political identity as shown, for example, by the millions who marched for immigrant rights in the spring of 2006.

Whereas: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a millennial Puerto Rican woman and democratic socialist,  has  become  by  far  the  single  most  prominent  Latinx  political  figure  in  the community and media, presenting extraordinary opportunities for the DSA.

Whereas: Addressing theLatinx community in the Spanish language is both a needed practical measure and an important political statement given the size of the DSA and its national presence.

Whereas: A socialist transformation of the United States is unthinkable without the massive, militant participation of Latinx working people.

Whereas, members have self-reported that they feel conflict resolution is inadequate locally and nationally;

Whereas, the National Grievance Officer has received a larger number of grievances and complaints than originally expected; and

## 9. Establishing a National Anti-Fascist Working Group

### Synopsis

<summary>Justification</summary>
Whereas, numerous DSA chapters have been threatened, infiltrated, and have otherwise experienced violence from fascist and alt-right organizations. Our members have been assaulted, doxed, and threatened because of their politics. It is imperative that we fight back against these aggressions.

Whereas, fascists and the far right pose an existential threat to marginalized communities, and it is theresponsibility of leftists to advocate for and protect these communities. People of color and LGBTQ+ people experience the brunt of fascist violence. Leftists, who believe in egalitarianism and equity, must fight for the safety of the systematically oppressed.

Whereas, antifascist tactics have been historically proven to disrupt and stop the incursion of fascism into vulnerable communities. 

Whereas, DSA, as the most prominent and mainstream socialist organization in the USA, is uniquely positioned to promote mainstream acceptance of antifascism as a viable tactic. Historically, DSA has not pulled its own weight in the struggle against the far-right. It is time that we change this. We have more power than any other leftist organization in the united states, and thus have the potential to massively impact the fight against fascism.

<summary>Action</summary>
Be it therefore resolved, DSA will create a national working group dedicated to antifascist organizing, tasked with the following duties:
* Providing information and instruction to help DSA members to disrupt fascist organizing in their region,
* Providing resourcesand trainings to help DSA chapters ensure securityat their meetings and events,
* Providing a secure online platform for antifascist organizing across DSA chapters,
* Coordinating antifascist praxis with existing antifascist and community defense groups; and

Be it finally resolved, the National Antifascist Working Group will have a process for interested DSA members to apply and join, that will assess whether they jeopardize the security of the other group members or the antifascist community at large.

* YDSA chapters do not benefit from dues splitting structure like DSA chapters do.
* Unlike DSA chapters, most YDSA chapters do not have a secure place to hold their money such as a bank account due to not being registered as an individual 501(c)4. Additionally, universities that do offer to hold money for YDSA chapters in their Bursar’s office do so to hold power over the YDSA chapter.
* University YDSA groups are dependent on the political whims of their host university for funding and high school YDSA groups have no avenue to receive funding other than by accepting donations.

### Synopsis

Whereas, our first priority is the electoral and political defeat of Donald Trump, the Trump-dominated Republican Party and the authoritarian forces aligned with them. The white nationalist, patriarchal,authoritarianism of Trumpism poses a ‘clear and present danger’ to working people and their unions, to people of color, to women, to LGBTQIA people, to immigrants, to members of minority religious faiths and to democracy itself;

And whereas,a Trump victory in the 2020 elections would consolidate an authoritarian state withthe most reactionary politics, expand imperial aggression abroad and shrinkthe political space for democratic and left forces at home;

And whereas, failure to prioritize the defeat of Trumpism would be nothing less than the abandonment of the struggles against the racism, sexism, white nationalism and bigotry against immigrants, Muslims and Jews that are central to Trumpism:

<summary>Action</summary>
Be it therefore resolved, defeat of Trumpism is a strategic imperative, the most important political task of our time; and

Be it further resolved,to defeat the Trump regime, the Democratic Party and candidates for office running as Democrats must adopt a progressive platform thatbreaks decisively with neoliberal politics and economics, rejecting the policies of austerity, privatization, economic deregulation and ‘race to the bottom’ free trade under corporate hegemony; and

Be it further resolved, DSA will promote the development of such a progressive platform, which places the interests of working people and their unions over corporations and the 1%, that takes on the economic impact of institutional racism and sexismin employment and social services, that addresses increasingly catastrophic climate change, protects abortion rights and reproductive justice and promotes the well-being of the great mass of U.S. working people, especially in the provision of fully-funded, universally accessible public goods in health care, education,housing and mass transportation; and 

Be it further resolved, DSA will vigorously support publicly avowed democratic socialists such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib (both DSA members), as well as other progressive elected officials. Bernie Sanders’ campaign for President deserves our support precisely because it can advance this progressive platform, even if he does not win the Democratic Party nomination.

Be it further resolved,DSA’s electoral workis most effective and has the greatest impact when we work cooperatively with other progressive organizations on the left –both mass organizations such as unions, civil rights organizations and community groups, and political organizations, such as Our Revolution, the Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats.

And whereas, DSA has experienced considerable membership churn,

And whereas, Locals often use a fraction of their membership or membership in good standing as a quorum number for their meetings, and knowledge of these numbers is necessary for full participation in some cases,

And whereas, an accurate picture of DSA membership numbers will allow members to plan membership drives and better understand what drives engagement in DSA,

And whereas, timely knowledge of new members helps locals to get them engaged in work;

Be it therefore resolved, DSA staff shall, beginning in September 2019, make available to members a monthly membership report that contains:
* The number of members in total and for each local,
* The number of members in good standing, in total and for each local,
* The number of new member sign ups in total in the previous month.

And be it further resolved, DSA shall, by April 1 2020, create an automated system to notify locals of both new member sign-ups and changes to memberships, including name changes, on a weekly basis.

## 20. Protection for Caucuses 

### Authors
* Ben C, Portland DSA, LSC
* Michael C, NYC DSA

### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
WHEREAS, DSA is committed to multi-tendency organizing and embracing a spectrum of leftist thought and organizing spaces for people of every identity, but there are no guarantees that the National Office or chapter leaderships will allow individual caucuses to organize. To fully realize that commitment to ideological diversity on the left, caucuses’ right to organize must be protected;
</details>

<details>
<summary>Action</summary>
Therefore be it resolved, all DSA members have the right to organize into caucuses based on shared identities, strategies, and ideological positions. A caucus is any such formalized free association of members at any level of the organization; and

Be it further resolved, all caucuses should have the right to promote their events and initiatives in official DSA communications channels, like any other event organized by DSA members; and

Be it further resolved, all caucuses should have the right toadvocate openly for their views in the organization, no matter how small a minority they may comprise, unless their core positions or collective behavior can be shown to violate the core principles of the organization as articulated in the Constitution; and 

Be it finally resolved, a national Caucuses Working Group will be formed to explore the possibility of amending the DSA Constitution or Bylaws to solidify these protections. The working group will have a method by which members of DSA may join and will be democratically structured. It will work to one aim: presenting an amendment proposal to the national membership. Should the Caucuses Working Group finalize such a proposal by 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time on December 31, 2020, ratification of the amendment will be decided by a referendum of the membership (with a quorum of four percent [4%] of the entire membership). Should this not be possible for any reason, the Convention Committee for the 2021 National Convention will place the question ofthe amendment on the order of the day for one of the dates of that convention.

## 21. Implement Electronic NPC Townhalls

### Authors
* Ben C, Portland DSA, LSC

### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
WHEREAS: 
* The National Political Committee (NPC) is authorized to act on behalf of the membership between conventions, and hold meetings to vote on issues important to the membership,
* Currently, there is little opportunity for NPC members to get a clear and full picture of the will of the membership on issues discussed at said meetings,
* Getting a better picture of the will of the membership will better align the NPC with the views and opinions of its constituent members;
</details>

<details>
<summary>Action</summary>
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
The NPC will hold town halls on a widely accessible teleconferencing technology of their choice, with attendance open to all DSA members and with a schedule and login information published on official DSA member-facing channels. The town hall meetings must consist primarily of question andanswer sessions where questions are not directly selected by the NPC, and they must be held no later than three weeks before any scheduled NPC meeting. Multiple sessions of the town hall may be held, and the agenda of the any scheduled NPC meeting must bepublished no later than 48 hours before the first session of such town hall meeting.

## 22. Local Dues Autonomy 

### Authors
* Fiona M, Portland DSA, LSC
* Kierstyn A, Portland DSA, LSC

### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
WHEREAS:
* The National Political Committee (NPC) returned only 4% of member dues, or $73,858 out of total expenses of $1,589,256, to local chapters in 2018; and, intends to only return 4% in 2019 according to their budget.
* Chapters which are not incorporated and don’t possess a bank account receive no dues share; thus, their members’ dues remain entirely with the national organization.
* Only monthly dues return a percentage to the chapter and annual dues don’t, but many members are unaware of this.
* Many active DSA members join because of and through their local chapter.
* Only being able to join through the National DSA is unnecessarily restrictive and limits the opportunities for recruitment via local organizing.
* Many people do not realize they can become members of DSA even if they don’t have a credit card, bank account, or the funds to pay dues.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Action</summary>
THEREFORE be it resolved:
By March 1 2020, National DSA shall create a mechanism to join DSA directly through a person’s local chapter, so that members pay dues directly to their Local, and the Local in turn pays National DSA on their behalf. Whether a person is inside a Local’s designated area or not, they may still use the National website to pay dues. When paying dues through the national website, members shall have the option to allocate money to their local, if such local is able to accept the funds. Members joining through the local mayspecify the allocation between the Local and National DSA, but not less than 20% to National DSA, or if they do not specify an allocation, half shall go to the Local andhalf to National DSA. Participating Locals shall create a method for signing up members and accepting dues at their meetings, and may create a method for members to sign up online. Member information shall be always safeguarded.

## 23. Updating DSA’s Harassment & Grievance Policy

### Authors
* Abby A, Chicago DSA, Bread & Roses
* Laura C, Chicago DSA, Bread & Roses
* Ella M, NYC DSA, NPC, Bread & Roses

### Synopsis

<details>
<summary>Justification</summary>
WHEREAS, in the two years since our last National Convention in 2017, experiences in local chapters have revealed serious holes in our National Harassment Policy, particularly regarding conflicts of interest and appeals. The final decision on most grievances is left up to local steering committees, members of which may have conflicts of interest that impact their decision-making;

WHEREAS, there is no appeals process able to provide a check on potential conflicts of interest clearly stated in the current policy; and no assurance that appeals will receive adequate review from multiple neutral parties 

WHEREAS, ensuring safe spaces free of harassment and abuse, and protecting survivors, is essential to our organizing, and 

WHEREAS, DSA should commit the necessary resources to make our organization safe, and make sure that our procedures enshrine democratic processes and support our members;
</details>

<details>
<summary>Action</summary>
BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that our Harassment Policy [Resolution 33 as adopted at the 2017 National Convention] be amended to include the following language, inserted in the indicated sections:

 [...] 2. Reporting Harassment [...]
 c. Reporting procedure and timeline [...]
 4. Neutrality. If chapter HGOs and complainants agree that, depending on the circumstances of the grievance or parties involved, the local chapter steering committee cannot be neutral in administering the decision of the grievance, then the grievance decision process may be sent to a panel of 5-7 national HGOs randomly selected from a pool of HGOs. I. It is encouraged that members of local steering committees recuse themselves from final decision of grievances if they do not believe that can be neutral in the administration of the grievance decision. 
 5. Emergent circumstances. Grievances alleging rape, sexual assault, or physical assault, must be immediately notified to the National HGO Staff Member and can be elevated to the National HGO Committee and supervised by one trained staff member at any point if the chapter HGOs and complainants agree. [...] 

D. National HGO Committee 
  a. The national HGO committee shall consist of all chapter HGOs, and any staff members charged with managing the National Grievance Procedure. 
  b. The committee shall undergo training required 
  c. The committee is charged with creating all forms necessary for facilitating the grievance process and making them available to members. 
  d. HGO’s shall recuse themselves from grievances that fall under the purview of Section C, 4 of this resolution if the grievance comes from their home chapter or they feel they are not in a position to neutrally review the case. [...]

3. Remedies and penalties [...]
 d. Appeals process. Either party may appeal the decision or form of relief determined by a local chapter Steering Committee to the National Grievance Officers by filling out an appellate form created by the National HGO Committee. Appeals must be filed within thirty days of receivingwritten notice of the Steering Committee’s decision. All appeals must be reviewed by the National HGO Committee as defined in Section D. The limited grounds for appeal are: 
  i. Either party believes the behavior was not interpreted using the standards forharassment set out in Section 1a; 
  ii. Procedural errors, misconduct, or conflicts of interest affected the fairness of the outcome; and 
  iii. The remedy or penalty determined by a Steering Committee was grossly disproportionate to the violation committed.
